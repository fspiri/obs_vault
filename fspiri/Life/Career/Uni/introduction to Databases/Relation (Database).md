In relational database theory and [[Relational Algebra]], a relations is a set of [[Tuples]] (d_1, d_2, ..., d_n), where each element d_j is a member of D_j, a data domain

Each element is termed an *attribute value*. An *attribute* is a name paired with a domain (nowaday most commonly referred as types or data types). An attribute value is an attribute name paired with an element of that attribute's domain, and a tuple is a set of attrivute values in which no two distrinct elements have the same name.
