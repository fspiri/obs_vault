# Vector
***
#### Definition
A vector is an object that has both a magnitude and a direction. Geometrically, we can picture a vector as a directed line segment, whose length is the magnitude of the vecor and with an arrow indicating the direction. The direction of the vector is from its tail to its head.
Two vectors are the same if they have the same magnitude and direction, This means that id we take a vector and translate it to a new position (without rotating it), then the vector we obtain at the end of this process is the same vector we had in the beginning.
