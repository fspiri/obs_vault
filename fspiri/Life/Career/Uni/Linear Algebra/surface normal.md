# Surface Normal
#### programming definition (simplified math):
If we have a segment going from ($x_1,y_1$) to ($x_2,y_2$) we can calculate its surface normale in the following way:
we define $dx = x_2-x_1$ and $dy = y_2-y_1$ then the normals are: 
($-d_y,d_x$) and ($d_y,-d_x$).
No division is required and so you don't risk dividng by zero.
