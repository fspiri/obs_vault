to find an algorithm that generates the vertices of a shape, time to think about it
so, for a cube the vertices are 8 : 
	{ -1, -1, 1 },  
	{ 1, -1, 1 },  
	{ 1, 1, 1 },  
	{ -1, 1, 1 },  
	{ -1, -1, -1 },  
	{ 1, -1, -1 },  
	{ 1, 1, -1 },  
	{ -1, 1, -1 }
The set of all the "regular shapes" is called Regular Convex Polyhedrons subdivided in: 
	Platonic Solids, Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra and five more compounds figures
and are represented by the Schl√§fli notation : {n, m} where n is the number of sides of each face and m the number of faces meeting at each vertex

All the vertices of these Regular Polyhedrons lie on a sphere: 
are distinguished by the Platonic solids: Tetrahedral, Octahedral and Icosahedral the last two contain the tetrahedral
