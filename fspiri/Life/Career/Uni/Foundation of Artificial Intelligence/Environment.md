# Environment
An environment in AI is the surrounding of the agent. The agent takes input from the environment through sensors and delivers the output to the environment through actuators.
There are different types of environments:

Fully Observable vs Partially Observable
Deterministic vs Stochastic
Competitive vs Collavorative
Single-agent vs Multi-agent
Static vs Dynamic
Discrete vs Continuous
Episodic vs Sequential
