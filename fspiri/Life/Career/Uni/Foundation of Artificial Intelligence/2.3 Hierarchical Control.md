# Hierarchical Control
The previous idea of an architecture of an agent into body and controller is a pretty bad architecture for intelligent systems, it is too slow and it is difficult to reach complex goals with such slowness.

A new improved architecture is one hierarchical like the one below

Each layer sees the below layer as a **virtual body** from which it gets percepts and to which it sens commands. The lower level are able to run much faster, react to those aspects of the world that need to be reacted fast and deliver a simpler view of the world to the higher layers, hiding inessentials informations.

There three types of inputs to each layer at each time:
- the features that come from the belief state, which are referred to as the remembered or previous values of these features.
- the features representing the percepts form the later below in the hierarchy
- the geatures representing the commands form the layer above in the hierarchy
And three outputs at each time:
- the higher-level percepts for the layer above
- the lower-level commands for the layer below
- the next values for the belief-state features

An implementation of a layer specifies how the outputs of a layer are a function of its inputs. Computing this function can involve arbitrary computation.

The goal is to keep each layer as simple as possible.

To implement a controller, each input to a layer must get its value from somewhere and each percepts or commands should be cnnected to an output of some other layer. The outputs of a layer can be connected to multiple layers or to none.
High-level reasoning, carried out in higher levels, is often discrete and qualitative, whereas lower-level is often continuous and quantitative. A controller that reasons in terms of both discrete and continuous values is called a **hybrid system**

#### Qualitative vs Quantitative
Much of science and engineering considers **quantitative reasoning** with numerical quantities, using differential and integral calculus as the main tools. **qualitative reasoning** is reasoning, often using logic, about qualitative distictions rather than numerical values for given parameters.

Qualitative reasoning uses discrete values, which can take number of forms:
- **Landmarks** are values that make qualitative disticntions in the indidual being modeled.
- **Order-of-magnitude-reasoning** involves approximare reasoning that ingores minor distinctions.
- **Qualitative derivatives** indicate whether some value is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same

A flexible agent needs to do qualitative reasoning before it does quantitative reasoning. Sometimes qualitative reasoning is all that is needed. Thus, an agent does not always need to do quantitative reasoning, but sometimes it needs to do both qualitative and quantitative reasoning.
