# 1.1 - What is Artificial Intelligence?
A program that, without being told how to do so, solves a problem
	
More specifically: [[Agents]] acting in an [[Environment]]

AI is the synthesis and analysis of coputational agents that acts [[intellligently]].

A **computational agent** is an agent whose decision can be explained in terms of [[computation]].

Most of AI softwares are used with an [[Any-Time Algorithm]]

[[Alphazero Algorithm]]
[[Markov's decision Processes(MDPs)]]

In Computer Science you know the HOW and search for the WHAT, whether in Artificial Intelligence you know the WHAT and search for the HOW.
