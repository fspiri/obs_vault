There are number of ways a controller can be used:

- [[embedded agent]]
- [[simulated agent]]
- [[agent system model]]

Each of these is appropriate for different purposes
- Embedded mode is how the agent must run to be useful
- Simulated agent is udeful to test and debug the controller when many design options must be explored and building the vody is expensive or when the environment is dangerous or inaccessible. It also allows us to test the controller in unusual conditions or combination of conditions that may be difficult to arrange in the real world
- A model of the agent, a model of the set of possible environments, and a specification of correct behavirous allow us to prove theorems about how the agent would work in such environments.
