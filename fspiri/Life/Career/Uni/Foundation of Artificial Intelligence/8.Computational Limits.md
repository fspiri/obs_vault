# 8. Computational Limits
Sometimes an agent can output the best actions to a given situations, sometimes, however it can't deu to some computational resource limits that prevent the agent from carrying out the best action.

Most of the time an agent must trade-off the quality of the action with the time spent calculating that action.

The **computational limit** dimensions considers whether the agent has 
- **perfect rationality** where an agent resons about the best action without any limitation
- **bounded rationality** where the agent must take in considerations some limitations, using an [[Any-Time Algorithm]]
