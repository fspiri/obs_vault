**Example 1.4:** A thermostat for a heater may have two belief states: _off_ and _heating_. The environment may have three states: _cold_, _comfortable_, and _hot_. There are thus six states corresponding to the different combinations of belief and environment states. These states may not fully describe the world, but they are adequate to describe what a thermostat should do. The thermostat should move to, or stay in, _heating_ if the environment is _cold_ and move to, or stay in, _off_ if the environment is _hot_. If the environment is _comfortable_, the thermostat should stay in its current state. The agent heats in the_heating_ state and does not heat in the _off_ state.
