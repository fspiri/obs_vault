# 6. Number of Agents
An agent reasoning is complex enough, having multiple agents together increases the complexity a lot.
An agent in a multiagent setting should reason strategically about the other agents, other agents may trick or manipulate or cooperate with the agent.

Taking the point of view of a single agent, the **number of agent dimension** considers whether the agent does
- **single agent** reasoning, where the agent assume that any other agents are just part of the environment. This makes sense in settings where the other agents don't change what they do based on the agent's actions.
- **multiple agents** reasoning, where the agent takes the reasoning of other agents into account. This happens where there are other agents whose goals or preferences depend on the agent's actions
