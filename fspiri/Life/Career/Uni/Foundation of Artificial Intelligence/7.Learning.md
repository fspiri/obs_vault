# 7. Learning
Sometimes a designer of an agent may have a good model of the environment and sometimes not needing for the agent to learn using data from past experiences and other sources.

The **learning dimension** determines whether
- **knowledge is given** 
- **knowledge is learned** (from data or past experiences)

Learning typically means finding the best model that fits the data. Sometimes is as simple as tuning some sets of parameters, other times it can also mean choosing the best representation over a class of representations.
