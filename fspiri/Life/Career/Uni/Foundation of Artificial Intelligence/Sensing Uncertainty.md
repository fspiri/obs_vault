# Sensing Uncertainty
In some case the agent can observe the entirity of the environment, where other times it can only observe some of it.

The Sensing uncertainty dimensions concerns whether the agent can determine the state from the observation:
- **Fully observable** is when the agent knows the state of the world from the observations
- **Partially observable** is when the agent does not directly observe the state of the world.
