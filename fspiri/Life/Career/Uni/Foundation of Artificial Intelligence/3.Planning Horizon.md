This dimension is about how far ahead in time the agent plans. 
##### for example
when a dog is called it immediately turn around, start running to get the immediate reward, whereas it cannot search for a long term goal, like in months or years like we human can. 

#### Planning Horizon
How far the agent "looks into future" when deciding what  to do is the planning horizon. That is how far in future the agent considers the consequences of its actions.

The time points considered by the agent when planning are called [[stages]]

In the planning horizon, an agent is one of the following
- A **non planning** agent is one that doesn't consider the future
- A **finite horizon** planner is one that looks for a fixed finite number of time steps ahead. The degenerate case in which the steps is 1 we call the agent **greedy** or **myopic**
- An **indefinite horizon** planner is one that look ahead some finite, but **not predetermined** amount of time
- An **infinite horizon** planner is an agent that plans on going on forever. Often called " a **process**".
