Agents act to have a better outcomes for themselves. The only reason to choose an action over another is because the preferred action will lead to more desirable outcomes.

The **preference dimension** is whether the agent has
- **goals**, either **achievement goals** to be achieved in some final states or **maintained goals** that must be maintained in all visites states.
- **complex preferences** involve trade-offs among the desirability of various outcomes, perhaps at different times. an **ordinal preference** is where only the ordering of the preference is important. A **cardinal preference** is where the magnitude of the values is important.
