# Solutions

**Optimal solution** - requires some measure of quality
**Satisfying solution** - relaxes some of the requirements
**Approximately optimal solution** - close enough to optimal
**Probable solution** - is very likely to be a solution

For deciding the correct solution, the [[Occam's Razor rule is applied]]
