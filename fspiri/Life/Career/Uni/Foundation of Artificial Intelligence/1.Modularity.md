Modularity is the extend to which a system can be decomposed into interacting modules that can be understood separately.
Modularity is typically expressed in terms of a hierarchical decomposition.

In the **modularity dimension**, an agent's structure is one of the following:
- **flat**: there's no organizational structure
- **modular**: the system is decomposed into interacting modules that can be understood on their own.
- **hierarchical**: the system is modular, and the modules themselves are decomposed into interacting modules, each of which are hierarchical systems, and this recursion grounds out into simple components.
