**Pisano Period**
uses the [[modulo operation]]
conscutive numberline and we apply a constant modulo to it, the remainder goes in circle btween some values like formod 3 we have 0, 1, 2, 0,  1, 2, and so on for the number 0, 1, ,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and so on

If we instead of the ordered numerline we can use the fibonacci sequence and apply a different module, this will produce a sequencee of results that repeats over time in a pattern, tis pattern is what's known as Pisano Period andthe length of the pattern is the value of this Period, for example mod 5 on the Fibonacci sequence will produce a Pisano Period of  20.
