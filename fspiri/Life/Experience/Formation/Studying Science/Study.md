Deep Processing - is the ability to read and understand
Studying != Learing: studying is physical process we're doing that tries to force learning, the higher the ratio, the bette the study technique

How the memory work?
MULTI STORE MODEL OF MEMORY
-	info comes as sensory information:forgotten very very quickly
-	if we want to save it, it gets shoved into the working memory forget (sec-min)
-	the memory that goes from the working memory to the Long term memory(LTM) goes through a process of endoding, an when we need to remember the stuff comes from the LTM through a retrieval process in the working memory (like mass memory goes into main memory). forget in (hours-months)

The encoding however doesn't happen without enough cognitive load

COGNITIVE LOAD
Congnitive load feels confusing, youre trying to figure it out, the brain is using high efficiency learning paths. If the studying feels boring or sleepy that mean tht the study method is no bueno :')
- When the "cerebral load" increases, then the learning increases too, until it reaches a load threshhold, after such the learning curve goes down = learn less
- the treshold can be trained

PASSIVE TRAINING
- happens when you're doing stuff that is not too heavy on the cognitive load or its too heavy that you don't learn much

ACTIVE LEARNING
- force the encoding process
- being comfortable with things being difficult and uncomfortable


ACTIVE RECALL
Works because it acts on the forgetting curve, it works becuase its easy to learn.
works if you're not doing any type of techniques or recall
the biggest caviat is that it has DEMINISHED RETURNS: the more you do it, the less efficient it gets. Very repetitive always fighting the forgetting curve.

if you can encode at 100% and remember for 6 months you don't need to fight the forgeting curve. It's impossible but we can get close.
We need to revise much lower

NEUROPLASTICITY
the ability of the brain to remodel its structure

why Active Recall is so famous and this encoding techniques are not?
	caue of the [[Dunnin Kruger Effect]]
