####Powerful food for the brain
Multiple studies have found out that saturated fat  foods greatly increase rates of alzheimer and mild brain impairement, as much as 80%. These diseases work by creating ball shape structure inside the brain, these structures contains saturated fats as well as iron and copper in their oxided form. 
The first parameters are to consume food low on saturated fat (<21.6g/day) and to eat foods high on vitamin E.
Vitamin E is a powerful anti-oxidant and destroys the free radicals in the brain: iron and copper oxides.
A little clause on vitamin E, there exists multiple different forms of vitamin E, studies have shown that the rate of absorbtion is reduced for all the other kinds that are not the one eaten: if we introduce too much vitamin $E_a$ then vitamin $E_b$ (and all others) absorbtion rate decreases.
Vitamin E is contained in almonds and seeds, so by crumbling ad sprinkling them on top of a salad is a good way of implementing them in the diet.
Another powerful source of anti-oxidants are all the blue vegetables: blueberries for example.
(When the oil or fat on something becomes hard in fridge it means its saturated)
The new system of intake is not a pyramid but it's a plate.
